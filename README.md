# scrape_uhc_data_tools

Scraping https://drexel-uhc.github.io/data-tools/ to build a notion database

Entirely vibe-coded using Positron Assistant ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

to import into notion, make sure that during the CSV import you set the img url one to text. then change type to files&media and it will auto download all images
